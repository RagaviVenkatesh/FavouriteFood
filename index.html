        <p>Pizza comes in a very big variety of tastes depending on ingredients, making, the size and texture etc. On their own, they taste pretty good.</p>

        <h3>SALAD</h3>
        <p>Your body can get the much-needed fibre with salads. Fibreâ€™s job is to reduce cholesterol and aid digestion. It also makes you feel full and prevents you from overeating.</p>
